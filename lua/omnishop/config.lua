  Rest of the config is under /entities/YOURNPC
  default NPC is omnishop_npc but that can be copied and modified to another name if you want to have two NPCs you could do
  omnishop_npc
  omnishop_npc_food
  REMEMBER THAT ALL OF NPCS MUST START WITH "omnishop_npc" OR IT WONT SAVE THEM. NO CHANGING NAME OF "omnishop_npcbase" EITHER
